# Origins: 

- Evolved from an earlier language called B, which was created by Ken Thompson.
- Written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in the 1970s
- C is closely tied to the development of the Unix operating system, originally implemented in ***assembly language***

# K&R C:

 The first widely used version of C was documented in "The C Programming Language" book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, published in 1978. This edition of C is often referred to as "K&R C."
