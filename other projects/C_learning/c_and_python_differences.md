# Topic of research

- comparing C with Python, and vice versa.
- analyse their similarities and differences by comparing source code written in both
- emphasising the syntactical and semantical changes.

# C and Python similarities and differences

## Introduction

- Python:
    - interpreted = much **slower** programs execution
    - high-level
    - general-purpose programming language

- C:
    - compiled = executes programs much **quicker**
    - general-purpose
    - procedural computer programming language

## Ease of use and syntax

Python is much easier to learn as it is a **high level** with simplistic syntax:
- Python is a dynamically typed language.
- It has a more concise syntax with dynamic typing; data types are inferred.
- Code blocks are defined by indentation using spaces or tabs (significant whitespace).
- No semicolons ';' are required for statement termination.
- Memory management is automatic (garbage collection).

Whereas C is much more <h2>**low level**</h2> programming language and more complex syntax:
- Statically typed language.
- Uses a more verbose syntax with explicit data type declarations.
- Code blocks are defined with curly braces '{}'.
- Semicolons ';' are used to terminate every statements.
- Indentation is not significant for code blocks; it's used for readability only.
- Memory management is manual (e.g., using 'malloc' and 'free').

## Declaration of variables

- Python:
    - no need to declare the type of variable.
    - Variables are untyped

- C:
    - type of a variable must be declared when it is created
    - only values of that type must be assigned to it
