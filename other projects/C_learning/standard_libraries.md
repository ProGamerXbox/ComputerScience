                providing low-level building blocks rather than high-level functionalities
                    more flexible and performant but can require more code for certain tasks.
                not as extensive as Pythonâ€™s in terms of built-in functionalities for various high-level tasks
                    frequently rely on third-party libraries
                        like parsing JSON or handling HTTP requests
                functionalities mainly focused on algorithms, containers, functions, and classes
