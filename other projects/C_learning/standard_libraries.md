# Standard Libraries

## Python and C Standard libraries differences

### Advantages

***Python:***

- aims to be comprehensive
- extensive
- rich set of modules and functions for string handling
- regular expressions, mathematics, operating system interface, internet protocols, and more
- robust standard library

***C:***

- conservative
- providing low-level building blocks
- more flexible and performant

- functionalities mainly focused on algorithms, containers, functions, and classes
    - These features are highly optimized and type-safe

### Disadvantages

***Python:***

- high level (can be advantage if using for it's simplicity)

***C:***

- not as extensive as Pythonâ€™s in terms of built-in functionalities for various high-level tasks
- frequently rely on third-party libraries
    - like parsing JSON or handling HTTP requests

# data processing

### Advantages

***Python:***

- known for its ease in handling data
- reading data from a file and performing basic operations is very simple

***C:***

- much more performant
    - where data sets are extremely large and computational efficiency is critical.


### Disadvantages

***Python:***

- much slower, less performance

***C:***

- doesn't have such high-level libraries in its standard library
    - wide range of third-party libraries
        - available for numerical computing and data processing
- require much more code for basic operations even when using a third-party library
- requires a callback function to handle the response data.
